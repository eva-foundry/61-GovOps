```

## 1. Health & metadata

### 1.1 — `GET /api/health`

```bash
curl -s "$BASE/api/health"
```

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "engine": "govops-demo",
  "version": "2.1.0",
  "jurisdiction": "ca",
  "program": "Old Age Security (OAS)",
  "available_jurisdictions": ["ca","br","es","fr","de","ua","jp"],
  "demo_mode": true,
  "llm_providers": ["groq","openrouter","gemini","mistral"]
}
```

✅ Version reports `2.1.0` · `demo_mode: true` · all 4 providers configured · 7 jurisdictions live (incl. JP).

### 1.2–1.3 — `GET /api/jurisdiction/{ca,jp}`

```bash
curl -s "$BASE/api/jurisdiction/ca"
# → {"id":"jur-ca-federal","jurisdiction_label":"Government of Canada",
#     "program_name":"Old Age Security (OAS)","default_language":"en",
#     "howto_url":"https://www.canada.ca/.../old-age-security.html"}

curl -s "$BASE/api/jurisdiction/jp"
# → {"id":"jur-jp-national","jurisdiction_label":"Nihon-koku (Japan)",
#     "program_name":"Kosei Nenkin Hoken (Employees' Pension Insurance)",
#     "default_language":"en","howto_url":"https://www.nenkin.go.jp/"}
```

✅ Substrate-driven `howto_url` resolves per jurisdiction (govops-022).

### 1.4 — `GET /api/jurisdiction/zz` (404)

```bash
curl -i "$BASE/api/jurisdiction/zz"
# HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
# {"detail":"Unknown jurisdiction: zz. Available: ['ca', 'br', 'es', 'fr', 'de', 'ua', 'jp']"}
```

✅ Unknown code returns 404 with helpful list.

### 1.5 — Demo-mode response headers

```bash
curl -s -D - -o /dev/null "$BASE/api/health" | grep -i x-govops
# x-govops-demo-mode: 1
# x-govops-demo-banner: Public demo on free tier - anything you do here is
#                       visible to other visitors and auto-expires after 7 days.
#                       Seeded data and the demo cases stay forever.
#                       Source: github.com/agentic-state/GovOps-LaC
```

✅ `DemoModeMiddleware` emits both headers on every response. The banner text is ASCII-only (HTTP headers are latin-1 per RFC 7230); the React frontend renders typographically correct copy from its i18n catalog.

---

## 2. Authority chain + cases

### 2.1 — `GET /api/authority-chain`

```bash
curl -s "$BASE/api/authority-chain" | head -c 200
# {"jurisdiction": {...}, "chain": [...]}
```

✅ Response shape: `{ jurisdiction, chain }` for the currently-selected jurisdiction (defaults to CA).

### 2.2–2.3 — `GET /api/rules`, `/api/legal-documents`

✅ Both return the seeded CA OAS rule set (5 formalised rules + linked Old Age Security Act documents).

### 2.4 — `GET /api/cases` (4 demo cases seeded)

```bash
curl -s "$BASE/api/cases"
# {"cases":[
#   {"id":"demo-case-001","applicant_name":"Margaret Chen","status":"recommendation_ready","has_recommendation":true},
#   {"id":"demo-case-002","applicant_name":"David Park","status":"intake","has_recommendation":false},
#   {"id":"demo-case-003","applicant_name":"Amara Osei","status":"intake","has_recommendation":false},
#   {"id":"demo-case-004","applicant_name":"Jean-Pierre Tremblay","status":"intake","has_recommendation":false}
# ]}
```

✅ All 4 demo cases present (`GOVOPS_SEED_DEMO=1` in the Dockerfile drives this).

### 2.5 — `POST /api/cases/demo-case-001/evaluate`

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE/api/cases/demo-case-001/evaluate" \
  | python -c "import sys,json;r=json.load(sys.stdin)['recommendation'];print(json.dumps({'outcome':r['outcome'],'confidence':r['confidence'],'rules_evaluated':len(r['rule_evaluations']),'benefit_amount':r['benefit_amount']['value'],'currency':r['benefit_amount']['currency']},indent=2))"
# {
#   "outcome": "eligible",
#   "confidence": 1.0,
#   "rules_evaluated": 6,
#   "benefit_amount": 735.45,
#   "currency": "CAD"
# }
```

✅ Deterministic engine + benefit-amount calculation + confidence reporting all functioning end-to-end.

### 2.6 — `GET /api/cases/demo-case-001/audit`

```bash
curl -s "$BASE/api/cases/demo-case-001/audit" \
  | python -c "import sys,json;d=json.load(sys.stdin);print(f\"audit_trail={len(d['audit_trail'])} entries · rules_applied={len(d['rules_applied'])} · authority_chain={len(d['authority_chain'])} layers\")"
# audit_trail=17 entries · rules_applied=6 · authority_chain=6 layers
```

✅ Full provenance trace (Decision → Rule → ConfigValue → Citation → Authority).

---

## 3. Citizen self-screening

### 3.1 — Eligible: 70-year-old citizen, 30 years residency

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{
  "jurisdiction_id":"ca",
  "date_of_birth":"1956-03-15",
  "legal_status":"citizen",
  "country_of_birth":"CA",
  "residency_periods":[{"country":"CA","start_date":"1996-01-01","end_date":null}],
  "evidence_present":{"dob":true,"residency":true}
}' "$BASE/api/screen"
```

✅ Returns `outcome: eligible · pension_type: partial · partial_ratio: 30/40 · benefit_amount: 551.59 CAD · 6 rule_results · _preview: false` (real backend — not a mock fallback).

### 3.2 — Ineligible: under 65

```bash
# date_of_birth: 1990-01-01, all else equal
# → outcome=ineligible, missing_evidence=[], benefit_amount=null
```

✅ Engine correctly rejects with no benefit amount.

---

## 4. Substrate (ConfigValues + impact)

### 4.1 — `GET /api/config/values?key_prefix=ca.rule&limit=3`

```json
{ "count": 7, "values": [
  {"key":"ca.rule.age-65.min_age","value":65,"author":"system:seed:rules.yaml"},
  {"key":"ca.rule.evidence-age.required_types","value":["birth_certificate"],"author":"system:seed:rules.yaml"},
  {"key":"ca.rule.legal-status.accepted_statuses","value":["citizen","permanent_resident"],"author":"system:seed:rules.yaml"}
]}
```

✅ Records load from `lawcode/*.yaml` with `author=system:seed:<filename>` per the v2.1 GC contract — these survive the daily 7-day age sweep forever.

### 4.2 — `GET /api/impact?citation=OAS+Act`

```bash
# total=1 jurisdictions=1 sections=1
# → Global · 1 value
```

✅ Citation impact search returns the single matching ConfigValue. (Larger results live in PR #7 work; CA seed substrate is small.)

---

## 5. Federation

### 5.1–5.2 — Registry + packs (initial empty state)

```bash
curl -s "$BASE/api/admin/federation/registry"   # → {"publishers":[]}
curl -s "$BASE/api/admin/federation/packs"      # → {"packs":[]}
```

✅ Empty initial state — no peer publishers configured yet (expected for v2.1; populated when a second repo federates per ADR-009).

---

## 6. LLM proxy

### 6.1 — Round-trip through provider chain

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"In one short sentence: what is Law as Code?"}],"max_tokens":80}' \
  "$BASE/api/llm/chat"
```

```json
{
  "provider": "groq",
  "model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
  "elapsed_ms": 260,
  "content": "Law as Code refers to the concept of expressing laws and regulations in a machine-readable format, using code, to facilitate automation, transparency, and efficiency in the application and enforcement..."
}
```

✅ First provider in chain (Groq) responds in 260 ms. Failover path (OpenRouter → Gemini → Mistral) untested live but proven by `tests/test_llm_proxy.py` (8 unit tests covering 429 / 5xx / network / malformed-response failover).

### 6.2 — Rate-limit headers

```bash
curl -s -D - -o /dev/null -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"max_tokens":5}' "$BASE/api/llm/chat" | grep x-ratelimit
# x-ratelimit-remaining-minute: 3
# x-ratelimit-remaining-day: 98
```

✅ `RateLimitMiddleware` decrements per request. After 5 requests in a minute, the next returns `429 + Retry-After: 60` (per `test_rate_limit.py`; not exhausted live to avoid blocking my own subsequent tests).

---

## 7. Admin GC (token-gated)

### 7.1–7.2 — Auth fence

```bash
curl -i -X POST "$BASE/api/admin/gc"
# HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
# {"detail":"valid `token` query parameter required"}

curl -i -X POST "$BASE/api/admin/gc?token=wrong"
# HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
```

✅ Endpoint refuses both missing and wrong tokens. (Successful invocation with the real `DEMO_ADMIN_TOKEN` is left to the operator; running it during this smoke test would reset the seeded demo state.)

---

## 8. UI routes (HTTP 200 + bytes + first-byte time)

| Path | Status | Bytes | Time |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `/` | 200 | 43,275 | 0.33s |
| `/about` | 200 | 44,069 | 0.38s |
| `/walkthrough` | 200 | 41,407 | 0.36s |
| `/authority` | 200 | 42,313 | 0.46s |
| `/screen` | 200 | 12,165 | 0.28s |
| `/screen/ca` | 200 | 13,595 | 0.38s |
| `/cases` | 200 | 24,396 | 0.30s |
| `/impact` | 200 | 11,290 | 0.30s |
| `/config` | 200 | 43,817 | 0.47s |
| `/admin/federation` | 200 | 24,791 | 0.41s |
| `/encode` | 200 | 19,435 | 0.33s |

✅ All 11 surfaces serve. Sub-second first-byte for every route. The v2 React UI loads with the demo banner sticky at the top.

## What this test does NOT cover

Documented for honesty:

- **Cold-wake from sleep** — Space sleeps after 48h idle; first request after wake is ~30s (the WarmingSplash component handles the UX, but we'd need to wait 48h to test it for real)
- **Provider fail-over in production** — only Groq was exercised live; OpenRouter / Gemini / Mistral take over only when Groq returns 429/5xx, which we can't induce on demand without hammering it
- **Rate-limit exhaustion** — covered by `tests/test_rate_limit.py` against an in-process FastAPI app, not exercised live (would block this test from continuing)
- **GC sweep removing user drafts** — would require waiting 7 days OR poking the demo to create old drafts, then triggering the admin GC with the real token; covered by `tests/test_gc_scheduler.py` (10 unit tests)
- **Federation pack import** — registry is empty by design; populated only when a peer publishes a signed pack
- **Encoder end-to-end** (`POST /api/encode/batches`) — would consume LLM quota AND create persistent state on the demo; left to a later integration test
- **Decision-notice rendering** — same persistence concern; covered by `tests/test_notices.py`

These are not test failures; they're intentional scope cuts to avoid burning provider quota and polluting the shared demo state.

## Issues caught and fixed during this deploy

Five HF-specific gotchas, all documented in `memory/v2_1_hosted_demo_plan.md`:

1. **Stale Windows credential** blocked initial push — cleared via Windows Credential Manager
2. **HF rejected GitHub history** because earlier commits had `web/bun.lockb` (binary) — solved with orphan-branch push (`git checkout --orphan` + force-push)
3. **HF rejected `docs/govops-{wordmark,symbol}.png`** + `web/brand/*.png` — committed cleanup; canonical assets live at `web/public/`
4. **Missing HF YAML frontmatter** in README — added Spaces metadata block (title, sdk, app_port, license); `short_description` has a 60-char hard cap
5. **Vite dev specifics**:
   - **Host allowlist** (`server.allowedHosts`) — needed when vite dev is the public-facing process inside a container
   - **`/api` proxy** — vite's SPA fallback was catching `/api/*` and serving `index.html` instead of forwarding to FastAPI
   - **`VITE_API_BASE_URL=""`** — must be empty so the browser uses same-origin relative URLs (the previous `http://127.0.0.1:8000` value was being inlined into the client bundle and the visitor's browser was trying to reach *its own* localhost)

The Dockerfile was pivoted from "production SSR build" to "vite dev server" because the `@lovable.dev/vite-tanstack-config` preset emits a Cloudflare Workers bundle (uses worker-entry imports, wrangler.json, nodejs-compat shims) that can't run as a vanilla Node process. Vite dev's HMR overhead is irrelevant on HF Spaces' 16 GB RAM tier — we trade dev-server perf for a working deploy in hours instead of days.

## Post-smoke-test bugs caught and fixed

The first 35-test pass was clean against the API endpoints, but a manual browser pass through the app surfaced two bugs the curl-only test missed (lesson: parameterised UI routes need their own pass; static `/cases` is not the same as `/cases/demo-case-001`).

### Bug 1 — `/cases/demo-case-001` returned 500 (SSR loader couldn't reach the API)

**Symptom**: clicking a case from the `/cases` list route loaded a 500-status SSR page; the React app never mounted; the inline `$_TSR.e` payload contained `Error("Case demo-case-001 not found")`.

**Reproduction**:
```bash
curl -i "$BASE/cases/demo-case-001"  # → HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
```

**Root cause**: The earlier `VITE_API_BASE_URL=""` fix (commit `fc19f64`) made browser-side fetches use same-origin relative URLs (correct, since Vite's dev proxy forwards `/api/*` to FastAPI). But the same `BASE=""` was also being read by the **server-side SSR Node process** when it pre-rendered route loaders, and Node's `fetch()` cannot resolve relative URLs. The route loader threw, the boundary returned "not found".

**Fix** (commit `f3c1a64`, `web/src/lib/api.ts`): branch on `import.meta.env.SSR`. Server-side always uses `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (FastAPI on container loopback); browser-side honours `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (empty → relative).

```ts
const BASE = import.meta.env.SSR
  ? "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
  : ((import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL as string | undefined) ?? "http://127.0.0.1:8000");
```

**After**: `/cases/demo-case-001` returns HTTP 200, 23 KB, with the full SSR-rendered case detail. Confirmed via `curl -s "$BASE/cases/demo-case-001" | grep -o "Margaret Chen"` (the demo case's applicant name) — present.

### Bug 2 — `/screen/jp` returned 404 (frontend allowlist trailing backend)

**Symptom**: visiting `/screen/jp` rendered the "404 Page not found" component instead of the JP self-screening form.

**Root cause**: The backend `JURISDICTION_REGISTRY` has 7 jurisdictions including JP (added 2026-04-28), but the frontend `SCREEN_JURISDICTIONS` allowlist in `web/src/lib/types.ts` still had 6. The route loader for `/screen/$jurisdictionId` calls `notFound()` if the param isn't in the allowlist.

**Fix** (commit `f3c1a64`):
- `web/src/lib/types.ts` — added `"jp"` to the const array
- `web/src/routes/screen.tsx` — added JP entry to `JURISDICTION_LABELS` (display "日本")
- `web/src/routes/screen.$jurisdictionId.tsx` — added JP entry to `PROGRAM_LABELS` (the network-failure fallback map)

**After**: `/screen/jp` returns HTTP 200, 13 KB, "Kosei Nenkin Hoken (Employees' Pension Insurance)" rendered. Substrate-resolved `howto_url` points at https://www.nenkin.go.jp/.

### Re-test of all parameterised routes (post-fix)

```
/cases/demo-case-001 → 200 23,323 bytes
/screen/ca           → 200 13,419 bytes
/screen/br           → 200 13,401 bytes
/screen/jp           → 200 13,417 bytes  ← was 404
/screen/fr           → 200 13,369 bytes
/config/approvals    → 200 367,700 bytes  ← was 31,593 (SSR now hydrating full data; previously silent failure)
/config/prompts      → 200 368,224 bytes  ← was 24,759 (same)
```

The `/config/*` size jump is the SSR fix landing for real — these pages render all 567+ ConfigValue records server-side. Sub-second response is still acceptable; if it becomes a UX cost later, the right move is server-side pagination on the `/api/config/values` shape rather than client-side virtualisation.

**Lesson**: future deploy smoke tests should explicitly cover one parameterised route per route-pattern. The 11-route static list isn't enough.
