# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Decisions captured here are load-bearing — they shape what gets built and what does not. The format is intentionally light: context, decision, consequences, alternatives. New ADRs get the next sequential number; superseded ADRs stay in place with a `Superseded by ADR-NNN` (or `Superseded by reality`) line in the status header.

Active track: **Law-as-Code v2.0** (see [PLAN.md](../../../PLAN.md)).

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:
- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Date**: ISO-8601
- **Context**: What is the issue?
- **Decision**: What did we decide?
- **Consequences**: What are the implications (positive, negative, mitigations)?
- **Alternatives Considered**: What other options did we evaluate?

## Contributing ADRs

When proposing a significant architectural decision:

1. Use the next sequential number (`ADR-NNN`)
2. Filename pattern: `ADR-NNN-short-kebab-title.md`
3. Status starts at `Proposed`; flip to `Accepted` when the decision is locked
4. Cross-link to the PLAN gate it satisfies (if any)
5. Add a row to the Index above in the same PR

Significant decisions include: technology stack choices, data model design, integration patterns, security/privacy approaches, performance strategies, testing frameworks, governance policies.
