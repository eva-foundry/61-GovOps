"""Program shape registry for GovOps v3.0 (per ADR-015 + ADR-016).

A *shape* is the contract a program manifest must satisfy. The shape catalog
is published under ``schema/shapes/`` (see ADR-015). Each published shape has
a Python *evaluator* registered here that implements the
:class:`ShapeEvaluator` Protocol — when the engine triages a case as
eligible (all rules satisfied), it delegates to the shape evaluator to
compute shape-specific outcome details (pension type, benefit duration,
obligations, etc.).

Per ADR-015's two-tier model, this module holds the **canonical published**
evaluators only. Local shapes (jurisdiction-specific shapes that haven't been
upstreamed) register themselves at deployment startup via the same
:func:`register_shape` API.
